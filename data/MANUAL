CUTEPAD MANUAL
==============================================

Cutepad (Qt notepad) is a lightweight plain-text editor based on Qt libraries.

It has some basic features, like cut-copy-paste, printing and some notable ones:

* syntax highligthing (based on KF5 Syntax Highlighting library)

* text zoom (NOT saved in settings, will be resetted on every restart)

* full screen work

* find && replace widgets

* current line highlight (with your preferred color)

* line numbers 
  (also in "smart mode, that is automatically enabled when working on code, disabled on plain text)

* tab replacement (with 4 spaces as default, changeable in the settings), useful when programming

* This MANUAL

And that's it! Ah... it also... WRITES plain-text files!!!
In fact this MANUAL has been written with Cutepad ;)
